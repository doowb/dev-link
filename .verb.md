## Usage

Link command line applications during development.
This is useful when doing development on globally installed apps
like [verb][] and [assemble][] while still using the published versions.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/app
$ dev link
linking "app" to "bin/cli.js"
```

Use the linked command link application by calling `dev` before the
normal `app` command.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/another/app
$ dev app
```
