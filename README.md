# dev-runner [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dev-runner.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dev-runner) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/doowb/dev-runner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/doowb/dev-runner)

> Run development versions of command line applications.

## Install

Install globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm install -g dev-runner
```

## Usage

Link command line applications during development.
This is useful when doing development on globally installed apps
like [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) while still using the published versions.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/app
$ dev link
linking "app" to "bin/cli.js"
```

Use the linked command link application by calling `dev` before the
normal `app` command.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/another/app
$ dev app
```

## Generate docs

Generate readme and API documentation with [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb):

```sh
$ npm install verb && npm run docs
```

Or, if [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb) is installed globally:

```sh
$ verb
```

## Running tests

Install dev dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install -d && npm test
```
